### Intelligent Proxy Service Architecture Plan

#### **1\. Core Design Philosophy**

This plan outlines a high-availability, self-managing, and intelligent proxy service. Its core philosophy is built upon **Decoupling by Layers** and a **Dynamic Feedback Loop**:

* **Decoupling by Layers**: We strictly separate a proxy's **"Physical Availability"** (whether the proxy is alive, its speed, etc.) from its **"Business Availability"** (whether the proxy can successfully access a specific target website). These two aspects are managed by different modules independently.  
* **Dynamic Feedback Loop**: The service is not a one-time load process but a continuously running ecosystem. A background scheduler constantly acquires new proxies and discards failed ones, while real-time business feedback adjusts a proxy's score for specific tasks, forming an intelligent, closed-loop system.

#### **2\. Core System Components**

The system is composed of the following core components:

1. **Scheduler**  
   * **Responsibility**: Runs as an independent background thread, acting as the engine that keeps the proxy pool "alive" and fresh.  
   * **Task**: Periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes) triggers a full "Fetch-Validate" cycle.  
2. **Fetcher**  
   * **Responsibility**: Downloads raw proxy lists (TXT files) from a series of URLs specified in the configuration file.  
   * **Output**: A large list of raw, unvalidated proxies.  
3. **Parallel Validator**  
   * **Responsibility**: Receives the raw proxy list and efficiently performs multi-dimensional validation. This is the key to ensuring the quality of the proxy pool.  
   * **Core Technology**: Utilizes multi-threading (ThreadPoolExecutor) or asynchronous I/O (asyncio) to concurrently send validation requests to all proxies.  
   * **Validation Dimensions**:  
     * **Liveness**: Requests a high-availability, simple website (e.g., httpbin.org/get) to determine if the proxy is online.  
     * **Latency**: Records the response time (in milliseconds) for successful connections. A timeout threshold (e.g., 5000ms) is set to discard slow proxies.  
     * **Anonymity**: (Optional) Accesses specific sites to check if the proxy reveals the user's real IP, classifying them as elite, anonymous, or transparent.  
   * **Output**: A filtered list of high-quality proxy objects, enriched with metadata (latency, anonymity level, etc.).  
4. **Tiered Proxy Pools**  
   * **ValidatedPool (Global Validated Pool)**: The foundational pool of the system. It stores all high-quality proxies that have passed the Parallel Validator's checks. This pool is periodically refreshed by the Scheduler to ensure it's always up-to-date.  
   * **SourcePools (Business-Specific Pools)**: The application layer of the system. Each business target (source) has its own independent proxy pool.  
     * **Initialization**: When a new source is created, its SourcePool is populated with all proxies from the ValidatedPool.  
     * **Replenishment**: When a SourcePool's number of available proxies runs low, it replenishes itself with currently live proxies from the ValidatedPool.  
5. **API Server**  
   * **Responsibility**: A Flask-based server that provides endpoints for client interaction.  
   * **Core Endpoints**:  
     * /get-proxy?source=\<name\>: Returns an optimal proxy from the specified SourcePool based on its score.  
     * /feedback: Receives feedback from clients about a proxy's performance for a specific source.

#### **3\. Data Structure Design**

1. **Proxy Object**: Proxies stored in the ValidatedPool are rich objects, not just URL strings.  
   {  
     "url": "http://1.2.3.4:8080",  
     "latency\_ms": 150,  
     "anonymity": "elite",  
     "country": "US",  
     "last\_validated\_at": "2025-07-26T12:00:00Z"  
   }

2. **Source Statistics Object**: For each proxy within a SourcePool, an independent statistics object is maintained.  
   {  
     "url": "http://1.2.3.4:8080",  
     "score": 10,  
     "success\_count": 20,  
     "failure\_count": 2,  
     "is\_banned": false,  
     "banned\_until": null  
   }

#### **4\. Core Workflows**

1. **Initialization Workflow**  
   1. The service starts and attempts to load its complete last session state from the proxy\_manager.pkl file.  
   2. If loading fails or the file doesn't exist, it performs a cold start, initializing an empty state.  
   3. The **API Server** is started to begin accepting requests.  
   4. The **Scheduler** background thread is started, initiating the first "Fetch-Validate" cycle.  
2. **Scheduled Task Workflow (Every 5 minutes)**  
   1. **Fetch**: The Fetcher downloads raw proxy lists from all source URLs.  
   2. **Validate**: The Parallel Validator concurrently validates all proxies in the list.  
   3. **Update**: The resulting list of high-quality proxies **replaces** the old ValidatedPool.  
   4. **Prune**: SourcePools automatically check and remove any proxies that no longer exist in the new ValidatedPool (as they are now considered dead).  
3. **API Request & Feedback Workflow**  
   1. A client requests /get-proxy?source=my\_app.  
   2. The service selects a proxy from the my\_app SourcePool, typically choosing randomly from the highest-scoring proxies.  
   3. The client uses the proxy for its business task.  
   4. The client submits the result (success/failure) via the /feedback endpoint.  
   5. The service updates the proxy's score, success\_count, or failure\_count within the my\_app SourcePool.  
   6. If the score drops below a certain threshold (e.g., \-15), the proxy's is\_banned flag is set to true, and a cooldown timestamp banned\_until is set (e.g., 30 minutes from now).  
4. **Proxy Lifecycle & Auto-Recovery**  
   * A proxy banned by a source is only marked as is\_banned within its corresponding SourcePool.  
   * It continues to be part of the global validation process performed by the Scheduler.  
   * When the get-proxy logic encounters a proxy whose cooldown period has expired (banned\_until \< now) and which still exists in the global ValidatedPool, it automatically sets its is\_banned flag to false and resets its score, allowing it to re-enter the available queue.

#### **5\. Configuration Management (config.ini)**

All variable parameters should be managed via a configuration file for easy deployment and tuning.

\[fetcher\]  
\# Comma-separated list of proxy source URLs  
source\_urls \= http://url1/proxies.txt,http://url2/proxies.txt

\[validator\]  
\# The target website for validation requests  
validation\_target \= http://httpbin.org/get  
\# Validation timeout in milliseconds  
validation\_timeout\_ms \= 5000  
\# Number of concurrent threads for validation  
validation\_workers \= 100

\[scheduler\]  
\# The execution interval for the background task in seconds  
interval\_seconds \= 300
